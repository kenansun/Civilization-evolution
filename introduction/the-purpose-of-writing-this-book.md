# The purpose of writing this book

&#x20;           My first job was as a programmer. In my daily work, I began to find that programs are needed in many places in life, but they are not attractive enough for capital. After having this idea, I began to think, what role does the current technological development play in the economy? What changes will future technology bring? How do we respond to changes brought about by technology?&#x20;

&#x20;            According to my understanding, the development of technology can gradually free people from direct labor.

People's work needs and technological developments conflict. The needs of work and survival are hindering the further spread of technology, thus slowing down the progress of technology. On the contrary, the advancement of science and technology is gradually squeezing the living space of ordinary people and bringing about a large gap between the rich and the poor.

&#x20;            From the perspective of the social economy, the development logic of the capital economy is to continuously earn excess profits from the market, rather than create social value. The purpose of such capital is to continuously play capital games in the stock economy and earn stock profits from the world's huge population market without innovating and transforming.

&#x20;            Today's pharmaceutical companies are facing such a situation, constantly launching new drugs, optimizing and grading existing market demand, and turning simple and effective treatment methods into complex and lengthy treatment plans. At present, most of the basic diseases known to people have obtained basic solutions. For pharmaceutical companies, this is the largest profit market, and a large amount of investment in the research and development of drugs for unpopular diseases is not enough for companies under private ownership. Adequate. From the perspective of social development, under the current social model of human beings, the progress of civilization is slowing down.
